This code has modules for computing different distributions for atomic trajectories of water.
The input file type MUST be an xyz file. See the file "input.yaml" before running the main executible
'main' found in the directory 'src'. The input file allows you to adjust some parameters like the 
number of oxygen atoms, hydrogen atoms, supercell dimensions, and it allows you to turn on/off 
modules. If a module is selected, there will be a message outputted to the screen upon completion
of the module. Since the dependency for libyaml is included in the directory, you do not need 
to install anything. 

                     TO RUN: './src/main'

                             OR
                             
                         './run_network_stats.sh'
                         
where the bash script will run main first and then compute network theory observables on the 
hydrogen bonded network formed in the atomic trajectories. For more information, please email me
