test1: 

	test 1 is a test to see if the network created is a complete circuit

test2:

	this tests periodic boundary conditions, make sure you set the supercell dimensions to [10, 10, 10]

test3:

	this tests the orientation code, and shows why we only have 0 - 180 degrees in the contour plots

test4:

    tests the network reorganization time function, should get a step function from 100-0 half way      through the plot (set pbcs to {20 20 20}, and time_length in nrt function to > 20)

test4_p2:
    
    another test for the network reorganization time function, should get oscillating 100's and 0's     if time_length > 25, or 0, 100, 0 if time_length = 4. set pbcs to {20 20 20}
